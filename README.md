# ConversionExtensionsGenerator

Generator for conversion extensions

This project can generate conversion extensions for your plain objects (like: Model -> DTO and DTO -> Model).

At current moment, project is a working prototype for very plain objects (mapping of primitives, enums, classes and collections) with similar fields/properties naming.

Later it will be improved.

You can check working examples in test folder.
